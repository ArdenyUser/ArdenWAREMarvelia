<h1>ArdenWARE OS 'Marvelia' 1.0</h1>
<p>ArdenWARE OS is running on Arch Linux. It soon will have VISIX installed on it. Go try it now at DistroWatch! This OS is retro styled, next we might make it less retro and more modern.&nbsp;<em>Thanks for your support!</em></p>
<h2>What is VISIX?</h2>
<p>Visix is a programming method, converting VIS code to .NET code. May be downloaded soon, or now (from the archive). Also it is planned to have a SDK.</p>
